# Lossy Image Compression using Autoencoders

This project demonstrates that we can use deep learning to compress images to very low bitrates and yet retain high qualities.This project was done as part of academic project for B.Tech degree by Abhishek Jha, Avik Banik, Soumitra Maity and Md. Akram Zaki of Kalyani Government Engineering College. This contains two already trained autoencoder and decoder model which we trained on kaggle. Currently it works only on PNG images.
